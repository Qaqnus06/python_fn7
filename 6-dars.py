# text = """When we say that accessing the 3rd element of an array has a time complexity of O(1), it means that 
# the time required to perform this operation is constant and does not depend on the size of the array. This constant 
# time complexity is achieved because of the nature of array data structures.

# In an array, elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, and each element can be accessed directly by its index. 
# The memory address of any element in the array can be calculated using the base address of the array and the index of the element. 
# Since the array provides direct access to any element, the time it takes to retrieve the value at a specific index is constant.

# Here's a simple explanation of the steps involved:

# Calculate the memory address: The memory address of the 3rd element is determined by adding the base address of the array to the product of the 
# index (3) and the size of each element in the array.

# Retrieve the value at that address: Once the memory address is calculated, the value stored at that location is directly retrieved.

# Since these operations involve a fixed number of steps and do not depend on the size of the array, the time complexity is O(1), indicating constant time. 
# It's important to note that this constant time complexity assumes that the array has random access, which is true for most programming languages. 
# In some cases, especially with linked lists or other non-contiguous data structures, accessing an element may have a different time complexity."""
